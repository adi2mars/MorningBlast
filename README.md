# MorningBlast
An app that allows you to connect to your Spotify Account and select alarms that will play your favourite songs, news, or podcast to motivate you to wake up and get productive. Also gives you a daily update of the quote of the day, weather, and news from around the world.

Used Work Manager, an API (Application Progamming Interface) to schedule tasks in the background of the app and the Alarm Manager, an API which allows for the deployment of apps on the exact time. Used the Spotify Java Library and the Spotify Android SDK to connect with the app and play specific track. Sent API requests from online APIs and parsed JSON objects (that is the data returned from APIs) to get the weather and and news. Used an RSS (Realy Simple Syndication) feed to get the quote of the day from BrainyQuotes.
